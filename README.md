# Dice game with 2 players

<p>Simple dice game made with JavaScript where two players roll dice until reaching 100 points.</p> 

<p>Player can roll the dice and the dice number would be added to the current score but if the rolled dice is 0 the current score is resetted and then the other player gets to play their turn. Players can hold their current score and that would be added to their total score. Game ends (resets) when a player reaches a total score of 100 or more.</p>

<p>Through this project I've learnt basic DOM manipulation and making my code more readable with less duplicate lines.</p>
